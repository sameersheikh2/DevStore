## 💡 Tips for Beginners

### Understanding the Flow

1. **User visits site** → App.jsx loads → Header shows navigation
2. **User searches** → Header dispatches action → Products page filters
3. **User adds to cart** → CartSlice updates → LocalStorage saves
4. **User navigates** → Router changes page → ScrollToTop runs

### Key Concepts

- **Components** = Reusable UI pieces (like LEGO blocks)
- **State** = Data that changes over time
- **Props** = Data passed from parent to child component
- **Redux** = Global state management (shopping cart across all pages)
- **API** = Getting data from external server
- **LocalStorage** = Save data in browser

### Debugging Tips

- Use browser Developer Tools (F12)
- Check Console tab for errors
- Use React Developer Tools extension
- Add `console.log()` to see data flow
